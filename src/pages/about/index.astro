            As a digital artist, I have been bringing a splash of color to the internet for years
            through my illustrations and designs. I assist brands in developing their visual
            identity and design language to make their products more appealing and accessible.
            Currently, I am building design tools and resources @overlayz. In my spare time, I love
            sharing my learnings and open-source design resources to help my fellow designers,
            developers, and enthusiasts.
