            As a FullStack developer passionate about creating experiences and driving digital
            innovation, I have spent the last 4 years building complex applications. My experience
            ranges from developing engaging user interfaces to implementing scalable and secure
            backend solutions, all with a focus on quality and efficiency using technologies such as
            NextJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, Golang, MongoDB, and more.

          <p class="text-base my-3 px-4 leading-[150%] tracking-[-0.25px]">
            In addition to my technical skills, I excel at working both in teams and independently.
            I enjoy collaborating with other professionals, sharing ideas, and finding innovative
            solutions to complex problems. My focus on clear and effective communication has allowed
            me to contribute significantly to projects, not only by providing creative solutions but
            also by helping to maintain a harmonious workflow. I am always looking for opportunities
            to improve and support the team in meeting common goals, adapting to different work
            styles and project needs.

            Recently, I have been dedicating time to learning AstroJs, a framework known for its
            focus on speed and simplicity, which has allowed me to refine my skills in developing
            modern and efficient web applications. This new knowledge has given me a fresh
            perspective on performance optimization and creating faster user experiences.
            Additionally, I am currently studying English at the Universidad Pedag√≥gica de Colombia,
            aiming to enhance my communication skills and prepare for collaborating with
            international teams, thus expanding my professional opportunities on a global scale.
